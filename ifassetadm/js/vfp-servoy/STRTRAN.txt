 STRTRAN() - utils.stringReplace()


Searches a character expression for a second character expression and replaces each occurrence with a third character expression.

 
VFP code example

? STRTRAN("Hello World", "Hello", "Servoy")  && returns Servoy World

 
Servoy code example

var cString = utils.stringReplace("Hello World", "Hello", "Servoy");
application.output(cString);  

// outputs  Servoy World


NOTE! There is also a string.replace() function but if you use this the way you are used to it will only replace the first occurrence of the searchstring! This is because it expects a regular expression instead of a string as a first parameter!

We don't have regular expressions in Visual FoxPro but they are very powerful and you will benefit greatly if you learn how to use them!

Here's a quick tutorial on how to use regular expressions and here are some examples.
