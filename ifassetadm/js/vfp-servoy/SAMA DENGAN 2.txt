 = | ==


This may be confusing at first but in Visual Foxpro the = operator is used both for testing equality and as an assignment operator. In Servoy/Javascript the = operator is an assigment operator only! The == operator is used for testing equality and works the same as in VFP. In VFP you can partially compare strings (where "abcde" = "abc" but only if SET EXACT=OFF) which you cannot do in Javascript (using the = operator).

 
VFP code example
x = 20                      && assigns 20 to variable x
? x=20                      && returns .T.
name = "Smith"              && assigns "Smith" to variable name  
? name = "Smi"              && returns .T. !!  
? name == "Smi"             && returns .F.  
? name == "Smith "          && returns .F. !!  
? name == alltrim("Smith ") && returns .T. 


 
Servoy code example
var x = 20;                 // assigns 20 to variable x
application.output(x=20);   // assigns 20 to variable x !!
var name = "Smith";
name == "Smi";              // returns false  
name == "Smith";            // returns true
