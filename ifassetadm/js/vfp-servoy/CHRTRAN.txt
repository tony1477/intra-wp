 CHRTRAN() - globals.CHRTRAN()


Replaces each character in a character expression that matches a character in a second character expression with the corresponding character in a third character expression. This function does not exist in Servoy/Javascript. Therefor it has been custom coded in the VFP2Servoy toolkit.

 
VFP code example

? CHRTRAN('ABCDEF', 'ACE', 'XYZ')          && Displays XBYDZF

 
Servoy code example

globals.CHRTRAN('ABCDEF', 'ACE', 'XYZ');   // Returns XBYDZF
