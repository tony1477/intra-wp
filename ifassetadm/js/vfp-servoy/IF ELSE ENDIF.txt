 Code Reference - if-else


The if statement is probably one of the very first statements you will be looking for since it's so commonly used in any programming language.

 
Visual Foxpro:

 
Syntax:

 
IF lExpression [THEN]
   Commands
[ELSE
   Commands]
ENDIF

 
Sample 1

 
IF var < 5
   var = var + 1
ENDIF

 
Sample 2

 
IF var < 5
   var = var + 1
ELSE
   var = var - 1
ENDIF

 

 

 
Servoy:

 
Syntax:

 
if (lExpression)
{
   Commands;
}
[else
{
   Commands;
}]

 
Sample 1

 
if (var < 5)
{
   var = var + 1;
}

 
Sample 2

 
if (var < 5)
{
   var = var + 1;
}
else
{
   var = var - 1;
}

 
Sample 3

 
if (x < y)
   return -1;
else if (x == y)
   return 0;
else
   return 1;

 

 
Conclusion
Not that different right? Except for maybe the last sample but that is actually a nested if. You can leave out the braces but then you can use only one command. I would recommend always using braces for sake of clarity. Otherwise when you add a command you might forget the braces.

 
Also don't forget that comparing values should always be done with == and not with the single equal sign. Why? Because the code below assigns a 3 to the variable x ...

 
if (x = 3)
{
   return
}
