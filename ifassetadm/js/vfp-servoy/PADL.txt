 PADL() - globals.PADL()


Returns a string with the length of nLength padded with cPadChar on the left.

 
VFP code example
myVar = "9"
? PADL(myVar,2,"0")       && Outputs 09

 
Servoy code example
var myVar = "9";
application.output(globals.PADL(myVar,2,"0"))  // Outputs 09

Note: PADL() is a function of the VFP2Servoy Toolkit

 
Conclusion
When you look at the code of the PADL function in the VFP2Servoy Toolkit you see that there is no easy way to do this in Servoy (or we haven't found it yet) so here using the function instead of the Servoy syntax saves time.
