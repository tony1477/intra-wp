 IIF() - if..else


Returns one of two values depending on the value of a logical expression. Although Javascript does not have an immediate if statement it is possible to achieve the same effect by writing an if..else on one line.

 
VFP code example
? IIF(i = 7, "Value of i is 7", "Value of i is NOT 7")

 
Servoy code exampleple
if(i==7){cString="Value of i is 7"}else{cString="Value of i is NOT 7"}
application.output(cString)

// alternatively:

var cString=globals.IIF(i==7, "Value of i is 7", "Value of i is NOT 7");
