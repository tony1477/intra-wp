 DO FORM - application.createNewFormInstance()


Create a new form instance. STOP! Before you run off to start initializing forms you should know that you usually don't have to create a new form instance. By default all forms are initialized and available through the Windows menu when the application is started.

So how do we activate a form then if it is allready initialized? Use application.ShowForm() instead. See the code below for an example.

 
VFP code example
 DO FORM frmTest

 
Servoy code example
// activate a form that has been initialized at application startup
// which is the default behaviour for all forms
application.showForm(forms.frmTest);

// If you want to instantiate an extra instance of a form then use
// application.createNewFormInstance()
application.createNewFormInstance("frmTest", "ofrmTest2");

// How about a modal dialog popup style form? Also check out the other
// JSWindow types
var win = application.createWindow("frmCustomers", JSWindow.MODAL_DIALOG); win.show("frmCustomers");
// And in the dialog close the form with the code or use the close box
controller.getWindow().destroy();
