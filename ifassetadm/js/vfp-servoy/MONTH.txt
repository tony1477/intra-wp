 MONTH() - date.getMonth()


Returns the number of the month for a given Date or DateTime expression.

 
VFP code example
month = MONTH(DATE())       && 1=January, 2=February etc.

 
Servoy code example
var d = new Date();
var month = d.getMonth();   // 0=January, 1=February etc.

Note: Alternatively use the MONTH() function of the VFP2Servoy Toolkit

 
Conclusion
Aargh, I think I will never get used to those zero-based indexes. I wonder how often people who are used to this get this mixed up.
