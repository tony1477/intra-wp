 GOMONTH() - date.setMonth()


Returns the date that is a specified number of months before or after a given Datetime expression.

 
VFP code example
d = GOMONTH(DATE(),-3)       && Go 3 months back in time

 
Servoy code example
var d = new Date(dDate.setMonth(dDate.getMonth() + nMonths));

Note: Alternatively use the GOMONTH() function of the VFP2Servoy Toolkit

 
Conclusion
I am glad Servoy/Javascript has the syntax to do this, because if you have to code the logic for this yourself things can get messy pretty quickly.
