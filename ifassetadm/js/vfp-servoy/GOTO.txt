 GO TOP - controller.setSelectedIndex(1);


Activates the record you specify provided it is in the foundset. Preferrably use the SEEK alternative. Note that a foundset is comparable with a remote view (but then without most of the disadvantages), by default the first 200 records are shown.

 
VFP code example
