 msg() - plugins.dialogs.showInfoDialog()


Simplified MESSAGEBOX() function. When using plugins.dialogs.showInfoDialog() or globals.MESSAGEBOX() there are quite a lot of options you can fill and code you need to type. If you just want to show a quick informative message with no other options then this is the fastest way. B.t.w. this is not an existing VFP function which is why it is not capitalized.

 
Servoy code example

globals.msg("Hello World!");   // quick message
