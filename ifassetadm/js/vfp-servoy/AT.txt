 AT() - string.indexOf()


Searches a character expression for the occurrence of another character expression and returns the position where the string was found. In Servoy the position is zero-based, the first character is at position 0, for VFP this is position 1. If the searchString was not found then VFP returns a 0 and Servoy returns -1. This is important to remember.

 
VFP code example

? AT("World", "Hello World")  && returns 7

? AT("Hi", "Hello World") && returns 0

 
Servoy code example

var cString = "Hello World";
application.output(cString.indexOf("World"))  // outputs  6 !!

application.output(cString.indexOf("Hi"))     // outputs -1 !!
